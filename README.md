# magnetmod
A magnet mod for evertech sandbox.
I have created this code and most of the images. It has no copyright, but if you feature it to the
online public please give me credit, it was a lot of work.

After downloading the zip file, extract the file inside and put it in your evertech mods file.

This mod features a single block, the magnet block, it has two modes pull and push. You switch the
modes by clicking the block, you turn it on by a connection for example, a switch, button, ect.
